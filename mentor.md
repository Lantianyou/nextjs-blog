Dear Ms Cooke:

Thanks for your warm reply. I have successfully implemented the dark mode!



Now I have a series of questions to ask you:

1. Why are your website so fast?

   Specifically, your website serve high quality image at an amazing speed. I am having trouble putting image downloaded from unsplash, because they are so big (3~20 mb). 

   Besides image compressing, how to display image of various sizes? For example, if the post’s container is 600px, and the image is 1200px*1000px, and I want the image display the full image into 600px*500px. 

   Which CSS property should I set, is there any best practices people follow?

   What is more, is there any check list you follow when developing a website to make sure it has amazing speed?

   

2. What is your blog’s database and its model schema?

   Firstly, what is the backend architecture of your website? I have noticed your posts have **author, tag, pagination, archive and comments** and those features require database. I am using Next.js so the backend is just node fetch markdown file and transform to html.

   Secondly, do you have any experience on so called ‘optimistic UI’? I would like to implement a ‘like’ button using this technology. I can find a post fromhttps://uxplanet.org/optimistic-1000-34d9eefe4c05

   By the way, is there any community focused on UI engineering or computer science in general. Google does not necessarily give me the full answer when search advanced knowledge. Furthermore, I would like to be exposed to a community introducing tricks, tips, best practices, great libraries, etc.

   A correlated question is about search, I suppose you use database to implement it. Can you tell me how to achieve it at a high level? I really have no idea where to start.

3. How to design?

   It may sounds like an absurd question, but when I design my website. I just went back and forth from chrome and vs code, which seems really stupid. Is there any design workflow to follow or tools to adopt?

   Most importantly, how did you learned CSS? The CSS books I bought is like a documentation, is there any hands on practices or a more systematic approach to learn? The animation and design of your website seemed very chic. How did you achieve that?

4. How to introduce a codebase?

   I would like to share my projects to my future employer. How to introduce a project? Would you mind sharing your experience.

5. How to learn react?

   You are quite experienced in using react. Lots of resources are just scratching the surface. How did you learn the real advanced stuff in React, for example React Fiber, the performance enhancement etc.

All those questions may seem overwhelming for you but there is no hurry. You can take your time, pick some questions easy to answer, and I only expect some high level answers, some resources link or recommended books.



Thanks,

Alan
